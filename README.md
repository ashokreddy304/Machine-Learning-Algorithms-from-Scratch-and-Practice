# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-from-Scratch-and-Practice

> A hands-on repository implementing common machine learning algorithms from first principles, with practical notebooks, visualizations, performance tests, and small real-world example datasets.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository is intended for learners and practitioners who want to deeply understand how classic supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms work by implementing them from scratch (pure Python / NumPy) and then applying them to real datasets. Each algorithm has:

* a clean-from-scratch implementation (no ML libraries for the core algorithm),
* a Jupyter notebook showing theory, derivation highlights, visualizations, and step-by-step usage,
* unit tests / correctness checks and simple performance benchmarks,
* one or more example datasets and end-to-end pipeline scripts.

This is perfect for interview preparation, coursework, or anyone who prefers to learn by building.

## 🔢 Algorithms Included (Core)

* Linear Regression (OLS & gradient descent)
* Logistic Regression (batch & stochastic gradient descent)
* k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
* Naive Bayes (Gaussian & Multinomial)
* Decision Tree (CART, Gini/Entropy splits)
* Random Forest (bagging + decision trees)
* Support Vector Machine (hinge loss primal via SGD)
* k-Means Clustering
* PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
* Gradient Boosting (simple additive trees)
* Perceptron and a small feed-forward neural net (from-scratch)

> Each implementation includes clear docstrings, complexity notes, and optional vectorized variants.

## 🧰 Requirements & Setup

A minimal Python environment is recommended (Python 3.9+).

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` contains packages used for notebooks, plotting and tests (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn only for benchmarking, pytest).

---

## ▶️ How to use

1. Inspect `algorithms/<algorithm>.py` for the core implementation.
2. Open the corresponding notebook in `notebooks/` to see theory, visual examples, and how to run it on a dataset.
3. Run example scripts in `examples/` for quick end-to-end usage.

Example: run a notebook with `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook` and execute cells.

## ✅ Tests & Benchmarks

Run the small test suite with pytest:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Benchmarks are intentionally lightweight and intended to compare your implementation to scikit-learn baselines (for educational purposes only).
